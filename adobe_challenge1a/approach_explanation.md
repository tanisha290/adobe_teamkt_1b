# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a sophisticated document analysis system that intelligently extracts and prioritizes relevant sections from document collections based on specific persona requirements and job-to-be-done scenarios. The approach combines multiple NLP techniques with domain-specific knowledge to deliver contextually relevant insights.

## Core Methodology

### 1. Persona and Job Analysis
**Keyword Extraction and Classification**
- **Persona Analysis**: We employ a multi-layered approach to understand persona requirements:
  - Pre-defined keyword mappings for common personas (researcher, student, analyst, manager, journalist, entrepreneur)
  - Dynamic keyword extraction from persona descriptions using NLP techniques
  - Context-aware keyword weighting based on professional domain expertise

- **Job-to-Be-Done Analysis**: 
  - Task-specific keyword identification (literature review, analysis, summary, preparation, research)
  - Semantic understanding of job requirements through keyword clustering
  - Temporal and priority-based keyword scoring

### 2. Document Structure Extraction
**Building on Challenge A Foundation**
- Leverages the PDF outline extractor from Challenge A to identify document structure
- Extracts hierarchical sections (H1, H2, H3) with page-level granularity
- Maintains document context and structural relationships
- Handles complex document layouts and multi-format content

### 3. Content Relevance Scoring
**Multi-Dimensional Relevance Analysis**

**TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity**
- Converts document sections into high-dimensional vector representations
- Uses TF-IDF to capture term importance and frequency
- Implements cosine similarity for semantic relevance scoring
- Handles n-gram features (1-2 grams) for better context capture

**Keyword-Based Scoring**
- Direct keyword matching with weighted scoring
- Persona-specific keyword relevance (40% weight)
- Job-specific keyword relevance (30% weight)
- Title-level keyword matching (20% weight)
- Content-level keyword density (10% weight)

**Hybrid Scoring Algorithm**
```
Importance_Rank = (TF-IDF_Similarity × 0.4) + 
                  (Persona_Keyword_Matches × 0.3) + 
                  (Job_Keyword_Matches × 0.2) + 
                  (Title_Keyword_Matches × 0.1)
```

### 4. Section Ranking and Selection
**Intelligent Content Prioritization**
- Multi-criteria ranking system combining relevance scores
- Dynamic threshold-based selection (top 20 sections)
- Cross-document comparison for global relevance
- Context preservation across document boundaries

### 5. Subsection Analysis
**Granular Content Extraction**
- Paragraph-level content segmentation
- Relevance scoring for individual text blocks
- Content refinement and length optimization (500 character limit)
- Quality filtering (minimum relevance threshold: 0.1)
